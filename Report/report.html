    <h1>Report</h1>
    <p>Introduction: I chose my site to represent a monthly newsletter containing recipes, cooking techniques, and general food-related content specifically pertaining to Genz and Millenials. A central location for picky-eaters o find foods that are easy on their taste-buds but still delicious and close to culture- Cameroonian culture. As a young Cameroonian, I get scoffed at for not eating “traditional foods”, however, as I try to convey in the newsletter, these foods are the new “traditional” as they are ubiquitous to the dining table of every Cameroonian, young and old, and I believe it is high time they are acknowledged as such. I chose to implement a basic structure that makes use of a lot of cards in navigation.</p>
    <p>Inspiration: I took inspiration for my site structure from the Google Local Guides Connect website which is very clean in design and easy to navigate. I share the same sentiment about the website of the Hustle newsletter as well. For the content of my newsletter, I drew some inspiration from a YouTuber “Cooking With Claudy” and I have one of her videos embedded on my home page.</p>
    <p>Accessibility: I have made use of very descriptive “Alt” tags with all images used in my project. Also, the navbar is responsive to allow accessibility of all the content on smaller devices. As much as possible, I have implemented appropriate “div” tags to allow a screen reader browse to the content of the web page. </p>
    <p>Usability: I followed a minimalistic design throughout the site. I find it easier to hrowse through the content that way, making sure not to include too many animations which might become distracting, and keeping a similar color scheme throughout. Users have the ability to access all the content of the site from the navigation bar. Also, the navbar sticks to the top of the page so content is always reachable.</p>
    <p>Learning:  I learned how to call DOM elements using Javascript from the course content. I also learned how to implement and modify a simple image carousel which I did using Slick. I found resources for this on the Slick official website, and github as well. While doing this project, I have come to know that it is always better to use relative paths when referencing images or other assets, in case the directory structure of the project changes. </p>
    <p>Evaluation 1: From the last web project, I think I was successful in keeping the color scheme minimalistic and not letting it get too out of hand like in the last project I did. 
        I found that it was easier to define a set of variables that contained colors that would make up the entire color scheme, rather than having to copy and paste RGB values and try to get too creative. Also starting to code with a wireframe already drawn was helpful to not get confused and sidetracked. 
        </p>
    <p>Evaluation 2: There is certainly a lot of improvement that could be applied to my newsletter. Firstly, the main content still uses placeholder text. Secondly, It is not as responsive as I would like it to be. The navbar, for example, has weird behaviour on the responsive screen where the “Content” dropdown menu does not close after it is opened except the page is refreshed. I would have also loved to implement the ability to get real data when users sign up for the newsletter on the “About” page. The footer would not remain at the bottom of the page although I set the bottom of the entire body to 0, and the height of the body to 100%. These, and a lot more are things I would love to improve in my newsletter as I continue to learn. </p>
